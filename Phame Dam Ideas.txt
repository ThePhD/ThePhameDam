Ah! Cows/sheep are squares, triangles are wolves, circle is you
You lead squares away from wolves, score is based on how many sheep/cows survive.

We'll use textures for squares, triangles, and circles. Not because it's hard, but because GeometricBatch isn't actually done, where SpriteBatch/NymphBatch is.

(Remember to implement GeoBatch after this)

Circle = You = Shepherd
Star = Sheepies
Triangle = Wolves
Blocks = obstacles -- can get blocked
