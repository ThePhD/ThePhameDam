Working to make a quick game in five hours! Woohoo!

Ah! Cows/sheep are squares, triangles are wolves, circle is you
You lead sheep/cows away from wolves, score is based on how many sheep/cows survive.

We'll use textures for squares, triangles, and circles. Not because it's hard, but because GeometricBatch isn't actually done, where SpriteBatch/NymphBatch is.

(Remember to implement GeoBatch after this)

Circle = You = Shepherd
Star = Sheepies
Triangle = Wolves
Blocks = obstacles -- can get blocked, maybe even dangerous? We'll just try blocking first

Jesus christ, I forgot to separate out input because I was still working on it! Better hop to it...

Bleh, changing core components really does hammer the compile times. It's gonna be quite a hefty while 'till I see pretty things on the screen.
